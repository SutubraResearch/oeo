    "BTS16 data includes production in dry tons and biomass prices in $2016/dry tons for energy crops like corn and soy, agricultural residues, woody biomass and wastes (raw data available [here](https://bioenergykdf.net/sites/default/files/BillionTonDownloads/billionton_county_all.zip)). Perennial grasses were modeled using acreage by U.S. State estimates from the conservation reserve program and corn ethanol land data. The acreage data from these two resources are subsequently represented on a dry ton basis using the yield data provided in NZA (Annex H Section 2.3 and Table 3). An energy density of 19.8 GJ/dry metric ton of biomass was assumed for representation on an energy basis (NZA Annex H). \n",

    "From BTS16, estimates from 2040 are used to build future projections of biomass potential while 2020 data is used to describe currently utilized resources. BTS16 projections end in 2040 and like in NZA we assume that the 2040 levels are the maximum available in 2040 and beyond. Table 1 in [NZA's Annex H](https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/img/NZA%20Annex%20H%20-%20Bioenergy%20transition.pdf) lists the subset of resources that are considered in their biomass representation from BTS16. Supply curves for OEO are constructed using the 'delimited' scenario by selecting only the respective feedstocks listed in this table. This scenario reflects the biomass potential projected from agriculture residues, woody residues, wastes and energy grasses grown on lands from conservation research program lands and from growing corn for ethanol. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps taken from raw production/price data to final OEO supply curve representations are detailed in the *BiomassSupplyCurves* Jupyter notebook. Briefly, state level production data was aggregated by binning the biomass feedstocks listed in Table 1 into the following broad categories: 1) waste 2) herbaceous and 3) woody biomass resources along with specific representations for corn, corn stover and soybeans. Production data was aggregated by the OEO regions. Finally, supply curves were constructed as the price versus quantity relationship for each of the aggregated resource categories (as well as corn, corn stover and soybeans).\n",
