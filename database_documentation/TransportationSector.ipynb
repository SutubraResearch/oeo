    "### 1. Transportation Sector Overview <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"transportation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The transportation sector in the OEO database can be split into three categories: light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles. All technology names start with T_LDV, T_MDV, or T_HDV, respectively. Demand commodity names follow the format TMD(L,M,H)DV_. For example, small SUV (SS) demand is represented as TMDLDV_SS, where TMD stands for transportation miles demanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent seven light-duty vehicle size classes, outlined in [Section 1.1](#light-duty-vehicles). We externally constrain the percent of end-use demand met by each size class. As Temoa optimizes for the least-cost solution, without this constraint, the model would deploy only cheap, fuel efficient minicars and compact cars. We base size-class demand distributions on the MARKAL USEPA9r database [(Shay et al., 2013)](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryID=150883).\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium-duty vehicles consist only of medium-duty trucks, corresponding to class 6 and 7 trucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavy-duty vehicles include heavy trucks, buses, passenger and freight rail, aviation, marine vessels, and off-highway vehicles. Each transportation technology meets a separate, exogenously specified end-use demand.  Depending on the technology, the demand may be in ton-miles, passenger-miles, or vehicle-miles traveled. Temoa does not currently allow for modal switching. For example, a long-haul truck cannot meet the same freight demand as a train; rather, the two have distinct exogenously defined demand profiles. Existing work shows that modal switching is one effective means of reducing transportation energy consumption, and we hope to incorporate modal models into the Temoa framework in the future [(Kaack et al, 2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aad56c/meta).\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeled transport modes are light-duty vehicles, trucks, buses, rail passenger, rail freight, subway, aviation, marine and off-highway. The demands for these transport modes are largely drawn from the USEPA9r database [(Shay et al., 2013)](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryID=150883) out to 2050 and can be met by various technologies. The majority of the transportation sector technologies and commodities match the most recent USEPA9r database workbooks, which as of July 2020 are VT_EPAUS9rT_TRNHDV_v20.1.0 and VT_EPAUS9rT_TRNLDV_v20.1.0 for heavy-duty and light-duty vehicles, respectively. Heavy-duty vehicle naming conventions are detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define technology-specific discount rates, or hurdle rates, for some technologies. Hurdle rates allow the modeler to account for consumer preferences otherwise ignored in a least-cost optimization model [2]. In the light-duty vehicle sector, we assume that conventional and hybrid gasoline-fueled vehicles (excluding plug-in hybrid vehicles) have a 5% hurdle rate, equal to the model's global discount rate, and all other powertrains have a 7.5% discount rate. For heavy-duty vehicles, conventional technologies have a 5% discount rate and alternative-fueled vehicles have a 10% discount rate."

    "Light-duty vehicles have the most detailed representation. Seven different size classes are specified for light-duty vehicles and each size class is constrained to contribute a fraction of total light-duty demand.

The size classes are mini compact, compact, full, small SUV, large SUV, minivan and pickup and their share in meeting light duty demand is 2.3%, 28%, 36%, 11.5%, 10%, 3.8% and 8.4%.

    "#### 1.2 Heavy-Duty Vehicles <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"heavy-duty-vehicles\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Truck technologies include heavy-duty short-haul, heavy-duty long-haul, medium-duty, and commercial.  In previous versions of the EPA database, heavy-duty trucking was split into short-haul and long-haul. This convention changed with v20.1.0; now the database only represents heavy-duty trucks in aggregate. The current database retains a distinction between short- and long-haul heavy trucks, as they differ in decarbonization technology availability. As such, the techno-economic parameters are taken from an older version of the database (v18.1.4). This older version did not include electric trucks. The characterization of electric short-haul heavy-duty trucks (T_HDV_THSELC_N) is based on technoeconomic parameters from [NREL’s electrification futures study (EFS)](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70485.pdf). The parameters match those for NREL’s “Heavy Duty BEV short-range” and are an average of the medium-, slow-, and rapid-advancement scenarios. Heavy-duty short-haul trucks are assumed to travel 27,390 miles per year, in accordance with EPA’s assumptions for annual vehicle miles traveled (vmt). The existing capacity is based on EPA’s database with the addition of B20 (electric heavy-duty trucks start in 2020, so have no existing capacity). The National Biodiesel Board reports that biodiesel “ranks first among fleets for alternative fuel use,” but no explicit percentage of fleet fuel consumption is given. It is assumed that 5% of existing diesel short-haul trucks use B20 as a first-pass estimate based on a [2018 report in the Biodiesel Magazine](http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2516343/biodiesel-ranks-first-among-fleets-for-alternative-fuel-use#:~:text=North%20America's%20top%20fleets%20have,blends%20in%20their%20diesel%20vehicles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavy-duty long-haul truck cost and efficiency parameters are taken from the International Council on Clean Transportation and include characterization of hydrogen fuel cell and LNG long-haul trucks. We assume that 1% of existing diesel vehicles are hybrids and an additional 5% of existing diesel vehicles run on B20. Additional data is needed to determine a more precise estimate. Similar to heavy-duty short-haul trucks, commercial truck efficiencies match v18.1.4 of the EPA databases save for electric trucks, which are drawn from NREL’s EFS. In this case, commercial trucks have the same technoeconomic parameters as NREL’s 300-mile range light-duty BEV truck [(NREL EFS)](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70485.pdf).

    "#### 1.4 Marine  shipping <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"marine\"></a>\n",
    "When modeling marine options, it is important to distinguish important characteristics of particular vessel types, such as annual ton-miles (or passenger-miles) traveled and engine power, and also to ensure that decarbonization options are adequately represented. For example, [(Minnehan and Pratt, 2017)](https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SAND2017-12665.pdf) note that passenger ferries may be able to operate on a battery, gaseous hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, and methanol, while a large containership’s decarbonization options are more limited. The heavy-duty shipping sector includes six vessel types: container ships, liquid bulk ships, general cargo ships, tugboats, offshore supply vessels, and passenger ships, which are given as a single category. These classifications correspond to those given in the annual publication of Waterborne Transportation Lines of the United States by the Institute for Water Resources (IWR), which provides data on the number of vessels, horsepower, and cargo or passenger capacity of U.S. flagged vessels [(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Institute for Water Resources)](https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16021coll2/id/3796/). The current OEO database uses only U.S. flagged vessels, and demand is only for domestic cargo and passenger transport. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the technical parameters for each vessel type were taken from the [European Environment Agency’s (EEA’s) Guidebook for International Maritime and Inland Navigation, National Navigation, National Fishing, and Recreational Boats](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-guidebook-2019). The EEA provides emission factors (EFs), average engine power ratings, average fuel consumption, and average load factor for multiple ship types. While EEA gives technical parameters for passenger vessels, their characterization includes large international cruise ships, which skews the estimate significantly. The IWR provides data on the main engine power rating for vessels in the domestic fleet; this data is used to determine the main engine power for domestic passenger vessels. The EEA estimates are used for freight vessels, as the process of pulling vessel engine characteristics from the IWR PDF document for thousands of domestic vessels is time-consuming. Excel spreadsheets exist, but to our knowledge, the workbooks do not include vessel classification (e.g., offshore supply vessel, cargo), meaning individual vessels would have to be matched with their classification from the PDF report. This effort will be considered for future work. The IWR does not provide an estimate of auxiliary engine power, but the EEA estimates the ratio of auxiliary engine power to main engine power by ship type. This estimate is used to determine an approximate auxiliary engine power for passenger vessels.\n",

    "The total existing cargo capacity of the U.S. flagged fleet (in billion ton miles) is estimated using the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/product/national-transportation-statistics) annual estimates of the number of ton-miles travelled by domestic freight vessels in the United States. The historical demand is in good agreement with the domestic shipping ton-miles reported by the Energy Information Administration in the [Annual Energy Outlook 2020](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/), which is subsequently used to forecast demand to 2050. For freight shipping, ton-miles traveled per vessel per year are estimated using an EPA workbook that pulls data from Lloyd’s register Fairplay as well as several literature studies [R. M. Weyl, R. Billings, and C. Gage, “MARKAL-MV ERG Final.” EPA Repository]. The workbook provides estimates of ton-miles traveled for containerships, general cargo ships, tankers (assumed to correspond to liquid bulk ships), tug boats, and “miscellaneous,” which is used to estimate freight work for offshore supply vessels. Annual passenger-miles traveled per vessel per year are estimated in the following way. The American Public Transportation Associations’ Public Transportation Fact Book (PTFB) reports passenger miles traveled (pmt) and vehicle miles traveled (vmt) by all ferries annually. The IWR gives the number of ferries, thus enabling the pmt per vessel per year for ferries to be calculated. The IWR “passenger” vessel category includes passenger carriers and excursion vessels in addition to ferries. To estimate the total pmt by all passenger vessels, we find the total passenger capacity for each vessel type from the IWR. We assume that the percent of the total passenger capacity by vessel type is equal to the percent of passenger miles traveled by each type. As neither vehicle miles traveled nor passenger miles traveled by each passenger vessel type are reported, passenger capacity is the only available metric to estimate the percentage of pmt demand met by each vessel type. According to the IWR, in 2017, ferries had 60% of the total passenger vessel passenger capacity. The Public Transportation Fact Book reports that ferries traveled 542.3 million passenger miles. Total demand in 2017 is then calculated as 542.3/0.6 = 908.83 million passenger miles. The EIA does not forecast passenger water transport demand for non-recreational boats; as such, demand is assumed to remain flat across the time horizon. It should be noted that passenger water transport results are less certain than freight due to the numerous estimations necessary for determining relevant parameters, but passenger transport by water represents a small fraction of total passenger transportation demand (less than 1%) so the impact on model solutions is low.\n",

We also assume that the efficiency of new ships increases as time passes. The [Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Greenhouse-Gas-Studies-2014.aspx) defines two efficiency improvement scenarios. The first assumes a 60% efficiency improvement in 2050 relative to 2012 levels and the second assumes a 40% efficiency improvement.

    "We base hydrogen vessel feasibility estimates on the Sandia report [(Minnehan and Pratt, 2017)](https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SAND2017-12665.pdf), which find that the majority of vessel classes are capable of running on liquefied hydrogen. Of the thirteen existing vessels considered in their analysis, they found ten would be able to run on liquid hydrogen based on voyage distance and mass and volume limitations. These vessels included a container ship, a general cargo ship, an offshore supply vessel, and a bulk cargo ship. Therefore, we define all freight shipping technologies with a liquid hydrogen option except tugboats, which were not considered in the study. Furthermore, a [2020 ICCT report](https://theicct.org/publications/zero-emission-container-corridor-hydrogen-2020) found that 99% of voyages made along the international shipping corridor between the San Pedro Bay and the Pearl River Delta could be fueled by hydrogen. We assume hydrogen ships will be available by 2030, based on an estimate from Flexport, according to an [NPR report](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/716693006/the-dawn-of-low-carbon-shipping#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Container%20ships%20and%20other%20maritime%20vessels%20currently%20run%20on%20pollutant,new%20fuels%20such%20as%20hydrogen). This is likely a conservative estimate, as some European countries plan to deploy hydrogen ships as early as 2021 ([see this article](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/flagships-project-gets-usd-5-6-mn-for-two-hydrogen-fueled-ships/#:~:text=Flagships%20Project%20Gets%20USD%205.6%20Mn%20for%20Two%20Hydrogen%2DFueled%20Ships,-Business%20%26%20Finance&text=The%20European%20innovation%20project%20Flagships,vessels%20in%20France%20and%20Norway.)).  To calculate vessel efficiencies, we use a slightly simplified version of the method outlined above. We use a single value for specific fuel consumption, taken from [Raucci, 2017](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1539941/), rather than a weighted average.

Passenger vessel efficiency is based on [(Cottrell, 2011)](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/4/2/239), whose work compared US ferry boat efficiencies to highway bridges crossing the same body of water. Cottrell’s work gives passenger-miles per gallon for eight ferry vessel companies operating 96 marine gasoil-powered ferries. Using this data yields an average efficiency of 0.092 billion passenger miles traveled per PJ. To benchmark both passenger and freight vessel efficiencies, as well as demand estimates, we compare total energy consumption for domestic shipping from our calculations to Annual Energy Outlook forecasts.\n",

    "This equation is taken from the [Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Greenhouse-Gas-Studies-2014.aspx), which includes the constant 0.98 as approximately 98% of fuel sulfur is converted to gaseous SO2. As of January 1, 2015, ships inside a sulfur emissions control area must use fuel that that is less than or equal to 0.1% m/m (or equivalently strict emissions control technology) [(Sulphur oxides (SOx) – Regulation 14)](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Sulphur-oxides-(SOx)-%E2%80%93-Regulation-14.aspx). To meet sulfur requirements, ships can use residual fuel oil (RFO) with a scrubber, marine gas oil, or an alternative fuel such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or hydrogen [(Zis et al., 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2549-05?journalCode=trra).  Additionally, ships must meet nitrogen oxide standards based on their construction date (see Table 9). It is assumed here that all existing vintages meet Tier II standards while new builds meet Tier III standards and that all vessels meet the sulfur standard, since it was implemented before the model’s first time period (2017). To meet NOx requirements, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technologies can be retrofitted onto vessels or alternative fuels may be used [(Jonge et al., 2005a)](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/task2_nox.pdf). For simplicity, it is assumed that all vessels using MGO are equipped with SCR technology and all vessels using RFO are equipped both with a scrubber and SCR. Relevant assumptions for emission factor calculations are that scrubbers reduce SO2 by 75% and PM by 25% from the ship and engine type baseline and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reduces NOx by 90% [(Jonge et al., 2005a)](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/task2_nox.pdf),[(Jonge et al., 2005b)](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/task2_so2.pdf).\n",

Variable costs are set to 6% of capital costs for each technology type.

We assume a representative train has three cars and as such, costs are adjusted to a three-car baseline. For example, Gattuso and Restuccia report that the AnsaldoBreda RegioStar has 8 cars and costs 8.55 M USD 2015 (converted from M EUR 2013). This is converted to a three-car basis by multiplying the total train cost by 3/8. Additional data is collected from several news articles noting the purchase of electric and diesel multiple unit trains [(source, ](https://metrarail.com/about-metra/newsroom/facts-about-metras-highliner-purchase ) [source)](https://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/02/rtds-new-rail-cars-for-fastracks-system-unveiled-to-public/).

Currently, existing capacity has been divided equally among the nine regions, however, this will be revisited in the near-term, using the state-level representation in the MARKAL database, to aggregate to the OEO regions. Relevant techno-economic paramters can be queried and displayed in the sections that follow. Note that all costs will be updated to 2018$ in the near-term."
